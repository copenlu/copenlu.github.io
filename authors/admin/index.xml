      <description>We gave a tutorial on &amp;lsquo;Explainability for NLP&amp;rsquo; at the first ALPS (Advanced Language Processing) winter school: http://lig-alps.imag.fr/index.php/schedule/ The tutorial introduces the concepts of &amp;lsquo;model understanding&amp;rsquo; as well as &amp;lsquo;decision understanding&amp;rsquo; and provides examples of approaches from the areas of fact checking and text classification.
Exercises for both model understanding and decision understanding are available here: https://github.com/copenlu/ALPS_2021</description>

      <title>Interested in joining us at the University of Copenhagen?</title>

      <description>The University of Copenhagen is a great place if you&amp;rsquo;re both interested in high-quality NLP research (we&amp;rsquo;re ranked 2nd in Europe and 19th in the world on CSRankings for NLP) and a high quality of life (Denmark has consistently been ranked one of the three happiest countries in the world, and ranks equally highly on the quality of life). In addition to this, Copenhagen is a lively, bustling capital, while still being small enough that one can cycle nearly everwhere within a short amount of time.</description>
