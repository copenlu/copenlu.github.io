We provide evidence that suggests these claims should be taken with a grain of salt: we find that state-of-the-art Natural Language Inference (NLI) models are sensitive towards minor semantics preserving surface-form variations, which lead to sizable inconsistent model decisions during inference. Notably, this behaviour differs from valid and in-depth comprehension of compositional semantics, however does neither emerge when evaluating model accuracy on standard benchmarks nor when probing for syntactic, monotonic, and logically robust reasoning. We propose a novel framework to measure the extent of semantic sensitivity. To this end, we evaluate NLI models on adversarially generated examples containing minor semantics-preserving surface-form input noise. This is achieved using conditional text generation, with the explicit condition that the NLI model predicts the relationship between the original and adversarial inputs as a symmetric equivalence entailment. We systematically study the effects of the phenomenon across NLI models for in- and out-of- domain settings. Our experiments show that semantic sensitivity causes performance degradations of 12.92% and 23.71% average over in- and out-of- domain settings, respectively. We further perform ablation studies, analysing this phenomenon across models, datasets, and variations in inference and show that semantic sensitivity can lead to major inconsistency within model predictions.","tags":[],"title":"Semantic Sensitivities and Inconsistent Predictions: Measuring the Fragility of NLI Models","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"5 papers by CopeNLU authors are accepted to appear at EMNLP 2023, on topics ranging from explainability to language modelling.\nExplaining Interactions Between Text Spans.

We can view current approaches as aiming to determine where gender assignment falls on a spectrum, from being fully arbitrarily determined to being largely semantically determined. For the latter case, there is a formulation of the neo-Whorfian hypothesis, which claims that even inanimate noun gender influences how people conceive of and talk about objects (using the choice of adjective used to modify inanimate nouns as a proxy for meaning). We offer a novel, causal graphical model that jointly represents the interactions between a noun's grammatical gender, its meaning, and adjective choice. In accordance with past results, we find a relationship between the gender of nouns and the adjectives which modify them. However, when we control for the meaning of the noun, we find that grammatical gender has a near-zero effect on adjective choice, thereby calling the neo-Whorfian hypothesis into question.","tags":[],"title":"Grammatical Gender's Influence on Distributional Semantics: A Causal Perspective","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yevgeniy Golovchenko","Karolina Stańczak","Rebecca Adler-Nissen","Patrice Wangen","Isabelle Augenstein"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1701216000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1701216000,"objectID":"d7b734ec8ac2447e6cd1e31835eda955","permalink":"https://copenlu.github.io/publication/2023_arxiv_golovchenko/","publishdate":"2023-11-29T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2023_arxiv_golovchenko/","section":"publication","summary":"Despite mounting evidence that women in foreign policy often bear the brunt of online hostility, the extent of online gender bias against diplomats remains unexplored. This paper offers the first global analysis of the treatment of women diplomats on social media. Introducing a multidimensional and multilingual methodology for studying online gender bias, it focuses on three critical elements: gendered language, negativity in tweets directed at diplomats, and the visibility of women diplomats. Our unique dataset encompasses ambassadors from 164 countries, their tweets, and the direct responses to these tweets in 65 different languages. Using automated content and sentiment analysis, our findings reveal a crucial gender bias. The language in responses to diplomatic tweets is only mildly gendered and largely pertains to international affairs and, generally, women ambassadors do not receive more negative reactions to their tweets than men, yet the pronounced discrepancy in online visibility stands out as a significant form of gender bias. Women receive a staggering 66.4% fewer retweets than men.

In this paper, we propose an original framework for probing language models for societal biases.

To this end, we leverage a novel perplexity-based fairness score.

When comparing our methodology with prior work, we demonstrate that biases within language models are more nuanced than previously acknowledged.

CADs introduce minimal changes to existing training data points and flip their labels; training on them may reduce model dependency on spurious features. However, manually generating CADs can be time-consuming and expensive. Hence in this work, we assess if this task can be automated using generative NLP models. We automatically generate CADs using Polyjuice, ChatGPT, and Flan-T5, and evaluate their usefulness in improving model robustness compared to manually-generated CADs. By testing both model performance on multiple out-of-domain test sets and individual data point efficacy, our results show that while manual CADs are still the most effective, CADs generated by ChatGPT come a close second.

Due to the scarcity of real historical scans, we propose a novel method for generating synthetic scans to resemble real historical documents.

Most notably, there is a lack of annotations capturing the human decision-making process w.r.t. the necessary interactions for informed decision-making in such tasks. To bridge this gap, we introduce SpanEx, a multi-annotator dataset of human span interaction explanations for two NLU tasks: NLI and FC. We then investigate the decision-making processes of multiple fine-tuned large language models in terms of the employed connections between spans in separate parts of the input and compare them to the human reasoning processes.

However, CQD does not handle negations and only uses the training signal from atomic training queries: neural link prediction scores are not calibrated to interact together via fuzzy logic t-norms during complex query answering. In this work, we propose to address this problem by training a parameter-efficient score adaptation model to re-calibrate neural link prediction scores: this new component is trained on complex queries by back-propagating through the complex query-answering process. Our method, CQDA, produces significantly more accurate results than current state-of-the-art methods, improving from 34.4 to 35.1 Mean Reciprocal Rank values averaged across all datasets and query types while using ≤35% of the available training query types.

One of the most widely used uncertainty approximation methods is Monte Carlo (MC) Dropout, which is computationally expensive as it requires multiple forward passes through the model. A cheaper alternative is to simply use the softmax based on a single forward pass without dropout to estimate model uncertainty. However, prior work has indicated that these predictions tend to be overconfident. In this paper, we perform a thorough empirical analysis of these methods on five datasets with two base neural architectures in order to identify the trade-offs between the two. We compare both softmax and an efficient version of MC Dropout on their uncertainty approximations and downstream text classification performance, while weighing their runtime (cost) against performance (benefit). We find that, while MC dropout produces the best uncertainty approximations, using a simple softmax leads to competitive and in some cases better uncertainty estimation for text classification at a much lower computational cost, suggesting that softmax can in fact be a sufficient uncertainty estimate when computational resources are a concern.","tags":[],"title":"Revisiting Softmax for Uncertainty Approximation in Text Classification","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Arnav Arora","Preslav Nakov","Vibha Nayak","Kyle Dent","Ameya Bhatawdekar","Sheikh Muhammad Sarwar","Momchil Hardalov","Yoan Dinkov","Dimitrina Zlatkova","Guillaume Bouchard","Isabelle Augenstein"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1686009600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1686009600,"objectID":"83d34e2ba951d5baaa05f315facc64de","permalink":"https://copenlu.github.io/publication/2023_csur_arora/","publishdate":"2023-06-06T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2023_csur_arora/","section":"publication","summary":"The proliferation of harmful content on online platforms is a major societal problem, which comes in many different forms including hate speech, offensive language, bullying and harassment, misinformation, spam, violence, graphic content, sexual abuse, self harm, and many other.

However, digitised historical documents pose a challenge for NLP practitioners as these corpora suffer from errors introduced by optical character recognition (OCR) and are written in an archaic language. In this paper, we investigate the continuities and transformations of bias in historical newspapers published in the Caribbean during the colonial era (18th to 19th centuries). Our analyses are performed along the axes of gender, race, and their intersection. We examine these biases by conducting a temporal study in which we measure the development of lexical associations using distributional semantics models and word embeddings. Further, we evaluate the effectiveness of techniques designed to process OCR-generated data and assess their stability when trained on and applied to the noisy historical newspapers. We find that there is a trade-off between the stability of the word embeddings and their compatibility with the historical dataset. We provide evidence that gender and racial biases are interdependent, and their intersection triggers distinct effects. These findings align with the theory of intersectionality, which stresses that biases affecting people with multiple marginalised identities compound to more than the sum of their constituents.","tags":[],"title":"Measuring Intersectional Biases in Historical Documents","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Nadav Borenstein","Natália da Silva Perez","Isabelle Augenstein"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1684540800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1684540800,"objectID":"dfb5db5c36f4544539143cfa06127685","permalink":"https://copenlu.github.io/publication/2023_acl_borenstein_multilingual/","publishdate":"2023-05-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2023_acl_borenstein_multilingual/","section":"publication","summary":"NLP methods can aid historians in analyzing textual materials in greater volumes than manually feasible. Developing such methods poses substantial challenges though. First, acquiring large, annotated historical datasets is difficult, as only domain experts can reliably label them. Second, most available off-the-shelf NLP models are trained on modern language texts, rendering them significantly less effective when applied to historical corpora. This is particularly problematic for less well studied tasks, and for languages other than English. This paper addresses these challenges while focusing on the under-explored task of event extraction from a novel domain of historical texts. We introduce a new multilingual dataset in English, French, and Dutch composed of newspaper ads from the early modern colonial period reporting on enslaved people who liberated themselves from enslavement. We find that: 1) even with scarce annotated data, it is possible to achieve surprisingly good results by formulating the problem as an extractive QA task and leveraging existing datasets and models for modern languages; and 2) cross-lingual low-resource learning for historical languages is highly challenging, and machine translation of the historical datasets to the considered target languages is, in practice, often the best-performing solution.","tags":[],"title":"Multilingual Event Extraction from Historical Newspaper Adverts","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Erik Arakelyan","Arnav Arora","Isabelle Augenstein"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1684540800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1684540800,"objectID":"b59ef48fef25cdc13a34ad48f1c719e9","permalink":"https://copenlu.github.io/publication/2023_acl_arakelyan/","publishdate":"2023-05-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2023_acl_arakelyan/","section":"publication","summary":"The task of Stance Detection is concerned with identifying the attitudes expressed by an author towards a target of interest. This task spans a variety of domains ranging from social media opinion identification to detecting the stance for a legal claim.

Furthermore, these stance annotations are significantly imbalanced on a per-topic and inter-topic basis. These make multi-domain stance detection a challenging task, requiring standardization and domain adaptation. To overcome this challenge, we propose Topic Efficient StancE Detection (TESTED), consisting of a topic-guided diversity sampling technique and a contrastive objective that is used for fine-tuning a stance classifier. We evaluate the method on an existing benchmark of 16 datasets with in-domain, i.e. all topics seen and out-of-domain, i.e. unseen topics, experiments. The results show that the method outperforms the state-of-the-art with an average of 3.5 F1 points increase in-domain, and is more generalizable with an averaged 10.2 F1 on out-of-domain evaluation while using 10% of the training data. We show that our sampling technique  mitigates both inter- and per-topic class imbalances.

We introduce the first template-based dataset in Czech, Polish, and Slovak for measuring gender bias towards male, female and non-binary subjects. We complete the sentences using both mono- and multilingual language models and assess their suitability for the masked language modelling objective. Next, we measure gender bias encoded in West Slavic language models by quantifying the toxicity and genderness of the generated words. We find that these language models produce hurtful completions that depend on the subject’s gender.

This paper systematically analyzes this in the out-of-domain setting, adding to the NLP literature which has focused on in-domain evaluation, and proposes new methods for acquiring soft-labels from crowd-annotations by aggregating the distributions produced by existing methods. In particular, we propose to aggregate multiple-views of crowd annotations via temperature scaling and finding their Jensen-Shannon centroid. We demonstrate that these aggregation methods lead to the most consistent performance across four NLP tasks on out-of-domain test sets, mitigating fluctuations in performance from the individual distributions. Additionally, aggregation results in the most consistently well-calibrated uncertainty estimation. We argue that aggregating different views of crowd-annotations is an effective and minimal intervention to acquire soft-labels which induce robust classifiers despite the inconsistency of the individual soft-labeling methods.","tags":[],"title":"Multi-View Knowledge Distillation from Crowd Annotations for Out-of-Domain Generalization","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Karolina Stańczak","Lucas Torroba Hennigen","Adina Williams","Ryan Cotterell","Isabelle Augenstein"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1669075200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1669075200,"objectID":"5f9c838c2b52729eb053cee6f3a933bd","permalink":"https://copenlu.github.io/publication/2023_aaai_stanczak/","publishdate":"2022-11-22T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2023_aaai_stanczak/","section":"publication","summary":"The success of pre-trained contextualized representations has prompted researchers to analyze them for the presence of linguistic information.

Prior work relies on discrete citation relations to generate contrast samples. However, discrete citations enforce a hard cut-off to similarity. This is counter-intuitive to similarity-based learning, and ignores that scientific papers can be very similar despite lacking a direct citation - a core problem of finding related research. Instead, we use controlled nearest neighbor sampling over citation graph embeddings for contrastive learning. This control allows us to learn continuous similarity, to sample hard-to-learn negatives and positives, and also to avoid collisions between negative and positive samples by controlling the sampling margin between them. The resulting method SciNCL outperforms the state-of-the-art on the SciDocs benchmark. Furthermore, we demonstrate that it can train (or tune) models sample-efficiently, and that it can be combined with recent training-efficient methods. Perhaps surprisingly, even training a general-domain language model this way outperforms baselines pretrained in-domain.","tags":[],"title":"Neighborhood Contrastive Learning for Scientific Document Representations with Citation Embeddings","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"2 papers by CopeNLU authors on probing question answering models are accepted to appear at Coling 2022.\nMachine Reading, Fast and Slow: When Do Models \u0026lsquo;Understand\u0026rsquo; Language?.

We study how this evolutionary scenario impacts the performance on a well established entity linking (EL) task. For that study, we introduce TempEL, an entity linking dataset that consists of time-stratified English Wikipedia snapshots from 2013 to 2022, from which we collect both anchor mentions of entities, and these target entities’ descriptions. By capturing such temporal aspects, our newly introduced TempEL resource contrasts with currently existing entity linking datasets, which are composed of fixed mentions linked to a single static version of a target Knowledge Base (e.g., Wikipedia 2010 for CoNLL-AIDA). Indeed, for each of our collected temporal snapshots, TempEL contains links to entities that are continual, i.e., occur in all of the years, as well as completely new entities that appear for the first time at some point. Thus, we enable to quantify the performance of current state-of-the-art EL models for: (i) entities that are subject to changes over time in their Knowledge Base descriptions as well as their mentions’ contexts, and (ii) newly created entities that were previously non-existing (e.g., at the time the EL model was trained). Our experimental results show that in terms of temporal performance degradation, (i) continual entities suffer a decrease of up to 4.6% EL accuracy, while (ii) for new entities this accuracy drop is up to 15.4%. This highlights the challenge of the introduced TempEL dataset and opens new research prospects in the area of time-evolving entity disambiguation.","tags":[],"title":"TempEL: Linking Dynamically Evolving and Newly Emerging Entities","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sagnik Ray Choudhury","Nikita Bhutani","Isabelle Augenstein"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1663286400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1663286400,"objectID":"61ee63df1b93e9360b216a2419d06602","permalink":"https://copenlu.github.io/publication/2022_coling_choudhury_edge/","publishdate":"2022-09-16T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2022_coling_choudhury_edge/","section":"publication","summary":"There have been many efforts to try to understand what grammatical knowledge (e.g., ability to understand the part of speech of a token) is encoded in large pre-trained language models (LM). This is done through `Edge Probing' (EP) tests: supervised classification tasks to predict the grammatical properties of a span (whether it has a particular part of speech) using only the token representations coming from the LM encoder. However, most NLP applications fine-tune these LM encoders for specific tasks. Here, we ask: if an LM is fine-tuned, does the encoding of linguistic information in it change, as measured by EP tests? Specifically, we focus on the task of Question Answering (QA) and conduct experiments on multiple datasets. We find that EP test results do not change significantly when the fine-tuned model performs well or in adversarial situations where the model is forced to learn wrong correlations. From a similar finding, some recent papers conclude that fine-tuning does not change linguistic knowledge in encoders but they do not provide an explanation. We find that EP models themselves are susceptible to exploiting spurious correlations in the EP datasets. When this dataset bias is corrected, we do see an improvement in the EP test results as expected.","tags":[],"title":"Can Edge Probing Tasks Reveal Linguistic Knowledge in QA Models?","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sagnik Ray Choudhury","Anna Rogers","Isabelle Augenstein"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1663286400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1663286400,"objectID":"4ae3728d516d5653445e105026c47c7b","permalink":"https://copenlu.github.io/publication/2022_coling_choudhury_machine/","publishdate":"2022-09-16T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2022_coling_choudhury_machine/","section":"publication","summary":"Two of the most fundamental challenges in Natural Language Understanding (NLU) at present are: (a) how to establish whether deep learning-based models score highly on NLU benchmarks for the 'right' reasons; and (b) to understand what those reasons would even be.

These pretraining methods are frequently extended with recurrence, adversarial, or linguistic property masking. Recently, contrastive self-supervised training objectives have enabled successes in image representation pretraining by learning to contrast input-input pairs of augmented images as either similar or dissimilar. In NLP however, a single token augmentation can invert the meaning of a sentence during input-input contrastive learning, which led to input-output contrastive approaches that avoid the issue by instead contrasting over input-label pairs. In this primer, we summarize recent self-supervised and supervised contrastive NLP pretraining methods and describe where they are used to improve language modeling, zero to few-shot learning, pretraining data-efficiency, and specific NLP tasks. We overview key contrastive learning concepts with lessons learned from prior research and structure works by applications.

This is likely tied to implicit gender biases against women in authority. In this work, we present a comprehensive study of gender biases that appear in online political discussion. To this end, we collect 10 million comments on Reddit in conversations about male and female politicians, which enables an exhaustive study of automatic gender bias detection. We address not only misogynistic language, but also other manifestations of bias, like benevolent sexism in the form of seemingly positive sentiment and dominance attributed to female politicians, or differences in descriptor attribution. Finally, we conduct a multi-faceted study of gender bias towards politicians investigating both linguistic and extra-linguistic cues. We assess 5 different types of gender bias, evaluating coverage, combinatorial, nominal, sentimental, and lexical biases extant in social media language and discourse. Overall, we find that, contrary to previous research, coverage and sentiment biases suggest equal public interest in female politicians. Rather than overt hostile or benevolent sexism, the results of the nominal and lexical analyses suggest this interest is not as professional or respectful as that expressed about male politicians. Female politicians are often named by their first names and are described in relation to their body, clothing, or family; this is a treatment that is not similarly extended to men. On the now banned far-right subreddits, this disparity is greatest, though differences in gender biases still appear in the right and left-leaning subreddits.

First, we conduct an in-depth empirical analysis of the task with a new fluency-preserving method for omitting information from the evidence at the constituent and sentence level. We identify when models consider the remaining evidence (in)sufficient for FC, based on three trained models with different Transformer architectures and three FC datasets. Second, we ask annotators whether the omitted evidence was important for FC, resulting in a novel diagnostic dataset, SufficientFacts, for FC with omitted evidence. We find that models are least successful in detecting missing evidence when adverbial modifiers are omitted (21% accuracy), whereas it is easiest for omitted date modifiers (63% accuracy). Finally, we propose a novel data augmentation strategy for contrastive self-learning of missing evidence by employing the proposed omission method combined with tri-training.

We argue that this higher prediction granularity may be useful for end tasks such as assistive writing, and allow for more a precise linking of language models with knowledge bases. We find that multi-sense language modelling requires architectures that go beyond standard language models, and here propose a structured prediction framework that decomposes the task into a word followed by a sense prediction task.

The framework is based on a nearest-neighbour architecture. It is a modern instantiation of the vanilla k-nearest neighbour model, as we use Transformer representations in all its components. Our framework can adapt to new source language instances, without the need to be retrained from scratch. Unlike prior work on neighbourhood based approaches, we encode the neighbourhood information based on query-neighbour interactions. We propose two encoding schemes and show their effectiveness using both qualitative and quantitative analyses. Our evaluation results on eight languages from two different datasets for abusive language detection show sizable improvements of up to 9.5 (for the Italian language) in F1 over strong baselines. On average we achieve 3.6 improvements in F1 for the three languages in the Jigsaw Multilingual dataset and 2.14 improvements in F1 for the WUL dataset.","tags":[],"title":"A Neighbourhood Framework for Resource-Lean Content Flagging","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Karolina Stańczak","Isabelle Augenstein"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1638316800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1638316800,"objectID":"a392da73ead1d47c072a85823e7704b4","permalink":"https://copenlu.github.io/publication/2021_arxiv_stanczak_survey/","publishdate":"2021-12-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2021_arxiv_stanczak_survey/","section":"publication","summary":"While the prevalence of large pre-trained language models has led to significant improvements in the performance of NLP systems, recent research has demonstrated that these models inherit societal biases extant in natural language. In this paper, we explore a simple method to probe pre-trained language models for gender bias, which we use to effect a multi-lingual study of gender bias towards politicians. We construct a dataset of 250k politicians from most countries in the world and quantify adjective and verb usage around those politicians' names as a function of their gender. We conduct our study in 7 languages across 6 different language modeling architectures. Our results demonstrate that stance towards politicians in pre-trained language models is highly dependent on the language used.

Explanation generation models are typically trained in a supervised way given human explanations. When such annotations are not available, explanations are often selected as those portions of the input that maximise a downstream task's performance, which corresponds to optimising an explanation's Faithfulness to a given model. Faithfulness is one of several so-called diagnostic properties, which prior work has identified as useful for gauging the quality of an explanation without requiring annotations. Other diagnostic properties are Data Consistency, which measures how similar explanations are for similar input instances, and Confidence Indication, which shows whether the explanation reflects the confidence of the model. In this work, we show how to directly optimise for these diagnostic properties when training a model to generate sentence-level explanations, which markedly improves explanation quality, agreement with human rationales, and downstream task performance on three complex reasoning tasks.","tags":[],"title":"Diagnostics-Guided Explanation Generation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Momchil Hardalov","Arnav Arora","Preslav Nakov","Isabelle Augenstein"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1638316800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1638316800,"objectID":"647c18fab9233a76b72ee26ac924796c","permalink":"https://copenlu.github.io/publication/2022_aaai_hardalov/","publishdate":"2021-12-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2022_aaai_hardalov/","section":"publication","summary":"The goal of stance detection is to determine the viewpoint expressed in a piece of text towards a target. These viewpoints or contexts are often expressed in many different languages depending on the user and the platform, which can be a local news outlet, a social media platform, a news forum, etc. Most research in stance detection, however, has been limited to working with a single language and on a few limited targets, with little work on cross-lingual stance detection. Moreover, non-English sources of labelled data are often scarce and present additional challenges. Recently, large multilingual language models have substantially improved the performance on many non-English tasks, especially such with limited numbers of examples. This highlights the importance of model pre-training and its ability to learn from few examples. In this paper, we present the most comprehensive study of cross-lingual stance detection to date: we experiment with 15 diverse datasets in 12 languages from 6 language families, and with 6 low-resource evaluation settings each. For our experiments, we build on pattern-exploiting training, proposing the addition of a novel label encoder to simplify the verbalisation procedure. We further propose sentiment-based generation of stance data for pre-training, which shows sizeable improvement of more than 6% F1 absolute in low-shot settings compared to several strong baselines.","tags":[],"title":"Few-Shot Cross-Lingual Stance Detection with Sentiment-Based Pre-Training","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Nils Rethmeier","Isabelle Augenstein"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1638144000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1638144000,"objectID":"7a48b0444680bf2d9c338f7890c33377","permalink":"https://copenlu.github.io/publication/2022_aibsd_rethmeier/","publishdate":"2021-11-29T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2022_aibsd_rethmeier/","section":"publication","summary":"For natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as sentiment or topic classification, currently prevailing approaches heavily rely on pretraining large self-supervised models on massive external data resources.  However, this methodology is being critiqued for: exceptional compute and pretraining data requirements; diminishing returns on both large and small datasets; and importantly, favourable evaluation settings that overestimate performance differences. The core belief behind current methodology, coined 'the bitter lesson' by R. Sutton, is that 'compute scale-up beats data and compute-efficient algorithms', neglecting that progress in compute hardware scale-up is based almost entirely on the miniaturisation of resource consumption. We thus approach pretraining from a miniaturisation perspective, such as not to require massive external data sources and models, or learned translations from continuous input embeddings to discrete labels.  To minimise overly favourable evaluation, we examine learning on a long-tailed, low-resource, multi-label text classification dataset with noisy, highly sparse labels and many rare concepts. To this end, we propose a novel 'dataset-internal' contrastive autoencoding approach to self-supervised pretraining and demonstrate marked improvements in zero-shot, few-shot and solely supervised learning performance; even under an unfavorable low-resource scenario, and without defaulting to large-scale external datasets for self-supervision. We also find empirical evidence that zero and few-shot learning markedly benefit from adding more `dataset-internal', self-supervised training signals, which is of practical importance when retrieving or computing on large external sources of such signals is infeasible.","tags":[],"title":"Contrastive Text Pretraining for Zero to Few-Shot Long-Tail Learning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Andreas Nugaard Holm","Barbara Plank","Dustin Wright","Isabelle Augenstein"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1638057600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1638057600,"objectID":"9fe861e88f4ab4f653bacaa3cf60c974","permalink":"https://copenlu.github.io/publication/2022_sdu_holm/","publishdate":"2021-11-28T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2022_sdu_holm/","section":"publication","summary":"Citation count prediction is the task of predicting the number of citations a paper has gained after a period of time. Prior work viewed this as a static prediction task. As papers and their citations evolve over time, considering the dynamics of the number of citations a paper will receive would seem logical. Here, we introduce the task of sequence citation prediction, where the goal is to accurately predict the trajectory of the number of citations a scholarly work receives over time. We propose to view papers as a structured network of citations, allowing us to use topological information as a learning signal. Additionally, we learn how this dynamic citation network changes over time and the impact of paper meta-data such as authors, venues and abstracts. To approach the introduced task, we derive a dynamic citation network from Semantic Scholar which spans over 42 years. We present a model which exploits topological and temporal information using graph convolution networks paired with sequence prediction, and compare it against multiple baselines, testing the importance of topological and temporal information and analyzing model performance. Our experiments show that leveraging both the temporal and topological information greatly increases the performance of predicting citation counts over time.","tags":[],"title":"Longitudinal Citation Prediction using Temporal Graph Neural Networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Andreas Holzinger","Matthias Dehmer","Frank Emmert-Streib","Rita Cucchiara","Isabelle Augenstein","Javier Del Ser","Wojciech Samek","Igor Jurisica","Natalia Díaz-Rodríguez"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1635724800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1635724800,"objectID":"34e508f96075f32b9333edb58950fe31","permalink":"https://copenlu.github.io/publication/2022_if_holzinger/","publishdate":"2021-11-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2022_if_holzinger/","section":"publication","summary":"Medical artificial intelligence (AI) systems have been remarkably successful, even outperforming human performance at certain tasks. There is no doubt that AI is important to improve human health in many ways and will disrupt various medical workflows in the future. Using AI to solve problems in medicine beyond the lab, in routine environments, we need to do more than to just improve the performance of existing AI methods. Robust AI solutions must be able to cope with imprecision, missing and incorrect information, and explain both the result and the process of how it was obtained to a medical expert. Using conceptual knowledge as a guiding model of reality can help to develop more robust, explainable, and less biased machine learning models that can ideally learn from less data. Achieving these goals will require an orchestrated effort that combines three complementary Frontier Research Areas: (1) Complex Networks and their Inference, (2) Graph causal models and counterfactuals, and (3) Verification and Explainability methods. The goal of this paper is to describe these three areas from a unified view and to motivate how information fusion in a comprehensive and integrative manner can not only help bring these three areas together, but also have a transformative role by bridging the gap between research and practical applications in the context of future trustworthy medical AI. This makes it imperative to include ethical and legal aspects as a cross-cutting discipline, because all future solutions must not only be ethically responsible, but also legally compliant.","tags":[],"title":"Information fusion as an integrative cross-cutting enabler to achieve robust, explainable, and trustworthy medical artificial intelligence","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"On 1 September 2021, the DFF Sapere Aude project EXPANSE on \u0026lsquo;Learning to Explain Attitudes on Social Media\u0026rsquo; is officially kicking off.

Therefore, fact-checking decisions on claim veracity should take into account temporal information of both the claim and supporting or refuting evidence. Automatic fact-checking models typically take claims and evidence pages as input, and previous work has shown that weighing or ranking these evidence pages by their relevance to the claim is useful. However, the temporal information of the evidence pages is not generally considered when defining evidence relevance. In this work, we investigate the hypothesis that the timestamp of an evidence page is crucial to how it should be ranked for a given claim. We delineate four temporal ranking methods that constrain evidence ranking differently: evidence-based recency, claim-based recency, claim-centered closeness and evidence-centered clustering ranking. Subsequently, we simulate hypothesis-specific evidence rankings given the evidence timestamps as gold standard. Evidence ranking is then optimized using a learning to rank loss function. The best performing time-aware fact-checking model outperforms its baseline by up to 33.34%, depending on the domain. Overall, evidence-based recency and evidence-centered clustering ranking lead to the best results. Our study reveals that time-aware evidence ranking not only surpasses relevance assumptions based purely on semantic similarity or position in a search results list, but also improves veracity predictions of time-sensitive claims in particular.

One way of improving model robustness is to generate counterfactually augmented data (CAD) for training models that can better learn to distinguish between core features and data artifacts. While models trained on this type of data have shown promising out-of-domain generalizability, it is still unclear what the sources of such improvements are. We investigate the benefits of CAD for social NLP models by focusing on three social computing constructs --- sentiment, sexism, and hate speech. Assessing the performance of models trained with and without CAD across different types of datasets, we find that while models trained on CAD show lower in-domain performance, they generalize better out-of-domain. We unpack this apparent discrepancy using machine explanations and find that CAD reduces model reliance on spurious features.

However, methodological issues emerge when employing them: lexica are often not very extensive, and the way they are constructed can vary widely -- from lab conditions to crowdsourced approaches and distant supervision. Furthermore, both categorical frameworks and dimensional frameworks coexist, in which theorists provide many different sets of categorical labels or dimensional axes. The heterogenous nature of the resulting emotion detection resources results in a need for a unified approach to utilising them. This paper contributes to the field of emotion analysis in NLP by a) presenting the first study to unify existing emotion detection resources automatically and thus learn more about the relationships between them; b) exploring the use of existing lexica for the above-mentioned task; c) presenting an approach to automatically combining emotion lexica, namely by a multi-view variational auto-encoder (VAE), which facilitates the mapping of datasets into a joint emotion label space. We test the utility of joint emotion lexica by using them as additional features in state-of-the art emotion detection models. Our overall findings are that emotion lexica can offer complementary information to even extremely large pre-trained models such as BERT.

We examine three approaches for this: (i) re-aligning the vector spaces of target languages (all together) to a pivot source language; (ii) removing languages-specific means and variances, which yields better discriminativeness of embeddings as a by-product; and (iii) normalizing input texts by removing morphological contractions and sentence reordering, thus yielding language-agnostic representations. We evaluate on the tasks of XNLI and reference-free MT evaluation across 19 selected languages. Our experiments demonstrate the language agnostic behavior of our multilingual representations, allowing better zero-shot cross-lingual transfer to distant and low-resource languages, and decrease the performance gap by 8.9 points (M-BERT) and 18.2 points (XLM-R) on average across all tasks and languages.

However, datasets for tasks with scientific text require expensive manual annotation and tend to be small and limited to only one or a few fields. At the same time, scientific documents contain many potential training signals, such as citations, which can be used to build large labelled datasets. Given this, we present an in-depth study of cite-worthiness detection in English, where a sentence is labelled for whether or not it cites an external source. To accomplish this, we introduce CiteWorth, a large, contextualized, rigorously cleaned labelled dataset for cite-worthiness detection built from a massive corpus of extracted plain-text scientific documents. We show that CiteWorth is high-quality, challenging, and suitable for studying problems such as domain adaptation. Our best performing cite-worthiness detection model is a paragraph-level contextualized sentence labelling model based on Longformer, exhibiting a 5 F1 point improvement over SciBERT which considers only individual sentences. Finally, we demonstrate that language model fine-tuning with cite-worthiness as a secondary task leads to improved performance on downstream scientific document understanding tasks.","tags":[],"title":"CiteWorth: Cite-Worthiness Detection for Improved Scientific Document Understanding","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Clara Meister","Stefan Lazov","Isabelle Augenstein","Ryan Cotterell"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1620259200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1620259200,"objectID":"8607ee26cdafaf25843420d6e1740537","permalink":"https://copenlu.github.io/publication/2021_acl_meister_sparse/","publishdate":"2021-05-06T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2021_acl_meister_sparse/","section":"publication","summary":"Sparse attention has been claimed to increase model interpretability under the assumption that it highlights influential inputs.

On three text classification tasks, we verify that only a weak relationship between inputs and co-indexed intermediate representations exists -- under sparse attention and otherwise. Further, we do not find any plausible mappings from sparse attention distributions to a sparse set of influential inputs through other avenues.

One notable task that requires multi-hop reasoning is fact checking, where a chain of connected evidence pieces leads to the final verdict of a claim. However, existing datasets do not provide annotations for the gold evidence pieces, which is a critical aspect for improving the explainability of fact checking systems. The only exception is the FEVER dataset, which is artificially constructed based on Wikipedia and does not use naturally occurring political claims and evidence pages, which is more challenging. Most claims in FEVER only have one evidence sentence associated with them and require no reasoning to make label predictions -- the small number of instances with two evidence sentences only require simple reasoning. In this paper, we study how to perform more complex claim verification on naturally occurring claims with multiple hops overevidence chunks. We first construct a small annotated dataset, PolitiHop, of reasoning chains for claim verification. We then compare the dataset to other existing multi-hop datasets and study how to transfer knowledge from more extensive in- and out-of-domain resources to PolitiHop. We find that the task is complex, and achieve the best performance using an architecture that specifically models reasoning over evidence chains in combination within-domain transfer learning.","tags":[],"title":"Multi-Hop Fact Checking of Political Claims","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"2 papers by CopeNLU authors are accepted to appear at ACL 2021.

Typological features from databases such as the World Atlas of Language Structures (WALS) are a prime candidate for this, as such data exists even for very low-resource languages. However, previous work has only found minor benefits from using typological information. Our hypothesis is that a model trained in a cross-lingual setting will pick up on typological cues from the input data, thus overshadowing the utility of explicitly using such features. We verify this hypothesis by blinding a model to typological information, and investigate how cross-lingual sharing and performance is impacted. Our model is based on a cross-lingual architecture in which the latent weights governing the sharing between languages is learnt during training. We show that (i) preventing this model from exploiting typology severely reduces performance, while a control experiment reaffirms that (ii) encouraging sharing according to typology somewhat improves performance.","tags":[],"title":"Does Typological Blinding Impede Cross-Lingual Sharing?","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Isabelle Augenstein"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1609804800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1609804800,"objectID":"2053e351c830223e7c32e1dc526bc186","permalink":"https://copenlu.github.io/publication/2021_habil_augenstein/","publishdate":"2021-01-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2021_habil_augenstein/","section":"publication","summary":"The past decade has seen a substantial rise in the amount of mis- and disinformation online, from targeted disinformation campaigns to influence politics, to the unintentional spreading of misinformation about public health. This development has spurred research in the area of automatic fact checking, from approaches to detect check-worthy claims and determining the stance of tweets towards claims, to methods to determine the veracity of claims given evidence documents. These automatic methods are often content-based, using natural language processing methods, which in turn utilise deep neural networks to learn higher-order features from text in order to make predictions. As deep neural networks are black-box models, their inner workings cannot be easily explained. At the same time, it is desirable to explain how they arrive at certain decisions, especially if they are to be used for decision making. While this has been known for some time, the issues this raises have been exacerbated by models increasing in size, and by EU legislation requiring models to be used for decision making to provide explanations, and, very recently, by legislation requiring online platforms operating in the EU to provide transparent reporting on their services. Despite this, current solutions for explainability are still lacking in the area of fact checking. A further general requirement of such deep learning based method is that they require large amounts of in-domain training data to produce reliable explanations. As automatic fact checking is a very recently introduced research area, there are few sufficiently large datasets. As such, research on how to learn from limited amounts of training data, such as how to adapt to unseen domains, is needed. This thesis presents my research on automatic fact checking, including claim check-worthiness detection, stance detection and veracity prediction. Its contributions go beyond fact checking, with the thesis proposing more general machine learning solutions for natural language processing in the area of learning with limited labelled data. Finally, the thesis presents some first solutions for explainable fact checking. Even so, the contributions presented here are only a start on the journey towards what is possible and needed. Future research should focus on more holistic explanations by combining instance- and model-based approaches, by developing large datasets for training models to generate explanations, and by collective intelligence and active learning approaches for using explainable fact checking models to support decision making.","tags":[],"title":"Towards Explainable Fact Checking","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"A paper by CopeNLU author is accepted to appear at EACL 2021.

Efforts to make the rationales behind the models' predictions transparent have inspired an abundance of new explainability techniques. Provided with an already trained model, they compute saliency scores for the words of an input instance. However, there exists no definitive guide on (i) how to choose such a technique given a particular application task and model architecture, and (ii) the benefits and drawbacks of using each such technique. In this paper, we develop a comprehensive list of diagnostic properties for evaluating existing explainability techniques. We then employ the proposed list to compare a set of diverse explainability techniques on downstream text classification tasks and neural network architectures. We also compare the saliency scores assigned by the explainability techniques with human annotations of salient input regions to find relations between a model's performance and the agreement of its rationales with human ones. Overall, we find that the gradient-based explanations perform best across tasks and model architectures, and we present further insights into the properties of the reviewed explainability techniques.","tags":[],"title":"A Diagnostic Study of Explainability Techniques for Text Classification","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Pepa Atanasova","Dustin Wright","Isabelle Augenstein"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1600128000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1600128000,"objectID":"a2f2c74ec0e577e1cd444fa0744bc9da","permalink":"https://copenlu.github.io/publication/2020_emnlp_atanasova_generating/","publishdate":"2020-09-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2020_emnlp_atanasova_generating/","section":"publication","summary":"Adversarial attacks reveal important vulnerabilities and flaws of trained models. One potent type of attack are universal adversarial triggers, which are individual n-grams that, when appended to instances of a class under attack, can trick a model into predicting a target class. However, for inference tasks such as fact checking, these triggers often inadvertently invert the meaning of instances they are inserted in. In addition, such attacks produce semantically nonsensical inputs, as they simply concatenate triggers to existing samples. Here, we investigate how to generate adversarial attacks against fact checking systems that preserve the ground truth meaning and are semantically valid. We extend the HotFlip attack algorithm used for universal trigger generation by jointly minimizing the target class loss of a fact checking model and the entailment class loss of an auxiliary natural language inference model. We then train a conditional language model to generate semantically valid statements, which include the found universal triggers. We find that the generated attacks maintain the directionality and semantic validity of the claim better than previous work.","tags":[],"title":"Generating Label Cohesive and Well-Formed Adversarial Claims","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Johannes Bjerva","Nikita Bhutani","Behzad Golshan","Wang-Chiew Tan","Isabelle Augenstein"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1600128000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1600128000,"objectID":"94bcd38aad28e992d9cdad9176777b26","permalink":"https://copenlu.github.io/publication/2020_emnlp_bjerva/","publishdate":"2020-09-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2020_emnlp_bjerva/","section":"publication","summary":"Subjectivity is the expression of internal opinions or beliefs which cannot be objectively observed or verified, and has been shown to be important for sentiment analysis and word-sense disambiguation.

Here, we investigate the problem of unsupervised multi-source domain adaptation, where a model is trained on labelled data from multiple source domains and must make predictions on a domain for which no labelled data has been seen. Prior work with CNNs and RNNs has demonstrated the benefit of mixture of experts, where the predictions of multiple domain expert classifiers are combined; as well as domain adversarial training, to induce a domain agnostic representation space. Inspired by this, we investigate how such methods can be effectively applied to large pretrained transformer models. We find that domain adversarial training has an effect on the learned representations of these models while having little effect on their performance, suggesting that large transformer-based models are already relatively robust across domains. Additionally, we show that mixture of experts leads to significant performance improvements by comparing several variants of mixing functions, including one novel mixture based on attention. Finally, we demonstrate that the predictions of large pretrained transformer based domain experts are highly homogenous, making it challenging to learn effective functions for mixing their predictions.","tags":[],"title":"Transformer Based Multi-Source Domain Adaptation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Farhad Nooralahzadeh","Giannis Bekoulis","Johannes Bjerva","Isabelle Augenstein"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1600128000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1600128000,"objectID":"e4942e363a103fa1884d677e21279505","permalink":"https://copenlu.github.io/publication/2020_emnlp_nooralahzadeh/","publishdate":"2020-09-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2020_emnlp_nooralahzadeh/","section":"publication","summary":"Learning what to share between tasks has been a topic of high importance recently, as strategic sharing of knowledge has been shown to improve the performance of downstream tasks. The same applies to sharing between languages, and is especially important when considering the fact that most languages in the world suffer from being under-resourced. In this paper, we consider the setting of training models on multiple different languages at the same time, when little or no data is available for languages other than English. We show that this challenging setup can be approached using meta-learning, where, in addition to training a source language model, another model learns to select which training instances are the most beneficial. We experiment using standard supervised, zero-shot cross-lingual, as well as few-shot cross-lingual settings for different natural language understanding tasks (natural language inference, question answering).

There are multiple isolated lines of research which address this core issue: check-worthiness detection from political speeches and debates, rumour detection on Twitter, and citation needed detection from Wikipedia. What is still lacking is a structured comparison of these variants of check-worthiness, as well as a unified approach to them. We find that check-worthiness detection is a very challenging task in any domain, because it both hinges upon detecting how factual a sentence is, and how likely a sentence is to be believed without verification. As such, annotators often only mark those instances they judge to be clear-cut check-worthy. Our best-performing method automatically corrects for this, using a variant of positive unlabelled learning, which learns when an instance annotated as not check-worthy should in fact have been annotated as being check-worthy. In applying this, we outperform the state of the art in two of the three domains studied for check-worthiness detection in English.","tags":[],"title":"Claim Check-Worthiness Detection as Positive Unlabelled Learning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Anna Rogers","Isabelle Augenstein"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1600041600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1600041600,"objectID":"d590de91307c1381d89e0774ed47e684","permalink":"https://copenlu.github.io/publication/2020_emnlp_rogers/","publishdate":"2020-09-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2020_emnlp_rogers/","section":"publication","summary":"Peer review is our best tool for judging the quality of conference submissions, but it is becoming increasingly spurious.

A major drawback hampering broader adoption of typological KBs is that they are sparsely populated, in the sense that most languages only have annotations for some features, and skewed, in that few features have wide coverage. As typological features often correlate with one another, it is possible to predict them and thus automatically populate typological KBs, which is also the focus of this shared task. Overall, the task attracted 8 submissions from 5 teams, out of which the most successful methods make use of such feature correlations.

Although many models provide confidence scores, and simple heuristics can go a long way towards indicating answer correctness, such measures are heavily dataset-dependent and are unlikely to generalise. In this work, we begin by investigating the hidden representations of questions, answers, and contexts in transformer-based QA architectures. We observe a consistent pattern in the answer representations, which we show can be used to automatically evaluate whether or not a predicted answer span is correct. Our method does not require any labelled data and outperforms strong heuristic baselines, across 2 datasets and 7 domains. We are able to predict whether or not a model's answer is correct with 91.37% accuracy on SQuAD, and 80.7% accuracy on SubjQA.

However, data encodes subjective content, which determines the possible outcomes of the models trained on it. Because such subjectivity potentially enables marginalisation of parts of society, it is termed (social) `bias' and sought to be removed. In this opinion paper, we contextualise this discourse of bias in the ML community against the subjective choices in the development process. Through a consideration of how choices in data and model development construct subjectivity, or biases that are represented in a model, we argue that addressing and mitigating biases is near-impossible. This is because both data and ML models are objects for which meaning is made in each step of the development pipeline, from data selection over annotation to model training and analysis. Accordingly, we find the prevalent discourse of bias limiting in its ability to address social marginalisation. We recommend to be conscientious of this, and to accept that de-biasing methods only correct for a fraction of biases.","tags":[],"title":"Disembodied Machine Learning: On the Illusion of Objectivity in NLP","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Nils Rethmeier","Vageesh Kumar Saxena","Isabelle Augenstein"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1589932800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1589932800,"objectID":"54f14e8b8547114f3515bff64e31ddfd","permalink":"https://copenlu.github.io/publication/2020_uai_rethmeier/","publishdate":"2020-05-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2020_uai_rethmeier/","section":"publication","summary":"While state-of-the-art NLP explainability (XAI) methods focus on supervised, per-instance end or diagnostic probing task evaluation[4, 2, 10], this is insufficient to interpret and quantify model knowledge transfer during (un-) supervised training. By instead expressing each neuron as an interpretable token-activation distribution collected over many instances, one can quantify and guide visual exploration of neuron-knowledge change between model training stages to analyze transfer beyond probing tasks and the per-instance level. This allows one to analyze: (RQ1) how neurons abstract knowledge during unsupervised pretraining; (RQ2) how pretrained neurons zero-shot transfer knowledge to new domain data; and (RQ3) how supervised tasks reorder pretrained neuron knowledge abstractions. Since the meaningfulness of XAI methods is hard to quantify [11, 4], we analyze three example learning setups (RQ1-3) to empirically verify that our method (TX-Ray): identifies transfer (ir-)relevant neurons for pruning (RQ3), and that its transfer metrics coincide with traditional measures like perplexity (RQ1). We also find, that TX-Ray guided pruning of supervision (ir-)relevant neuron-knowledge (RQ3) can identify `lottery ticket'-like [9, 40] neurons that drive model performance and robustness. Upon inspecting pruned neurons, we find that task-relevant neuron-knowledge (`tickets'), appear (over-)fit, while task-irrelevant neurons lower overfitting, i.e. TX-Ray identifies neurons that generalize, transfer or specialize model-knowledge [25]. Finally, through RQ1-3, we find that TX-Ray helps to explore and quantify dynamics of (continual) knowledge transfer and that it can shed light on neuron-knowledge specialization and generalization, to complement (costly) supervised probing task procurement and established `summary' statistics like perplexity, ROC or F scores.","tags":[],"title":"TX-Ray: Quantifying and Explaining Model-Knowledge Transfer in (Un-)Supervised NLP","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"2 papers by CopeNLU authors are accepted to appear at ACL 2020.

This paper provides the first study of how these explanations can be generated automatically based on available claim context, and how this task can be modeled jointly with veracity prediction.

We propose a novel generative latent-variable model, to be trained on a large corpus, that jointly represents adjective (or verb) choice with its sentiment given the natural gender of the head (or dependent) noun.

The implied covariance between features inspires our probabilisation of this line of linguistic inquiry---we develop a generative model of language based on exponential-family matrix factorisation. By modelling all languages and features within the same architecture, we show how structural similarities between languages can be exploited to predict typological features with near-perfect accuracy, besting several baselines on the task of predicting held-out features. Furthermore, we show that language representations pre-trained on monolingual text allow for generalisation to unobserved languages. This finding has clear practical and also theoretical implications: the results confirm what linguists have hypothesised, i.e. that there are significant correlations between typological features and languages.","tags":[],"title":"A Probabilistic Generative Model of Linguistic Typology","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alexander Hoyle","Lawrence Wolf-Sonkin","Hanna Wallach","Ryan Cotterell","Isabelle Augenstein"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1550793600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1550793600,"objectID":"bb5d04545be8a1e5502706ae3d78a674","permalink":"https://copenlu.github.io/publication/2019_naacl_hoyle/","publishdate":"2019-02-22T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2019_naacl_hoyle/","section":"publication","summary":"When assigning quantitative labels to a dataset, different methodologies may rely on different scales. In particular, when assigning polarities to words in a sentiment lexicon, annotators may use binary, categorical, or continuous labels. Naturally, it is of interest to unify these labels from disparate scales to both achieve maximal coverage over words and to create a single, more robust sentiment lexicon while retaining scale coherence. We introduce a generative model of sentiment lexica to combine disparate scales into a common latent representation. We realize this model with a novel multi-view variational autoencoder (VAE), called SentiVAE.

In addition to this, Copenhagen is a lively, bustling capital, while still being small enough that one can cycle nearly everwhere within a short amount of time. Intrigued? Read on!\n Life in Copenhagen NLP Research at the University of Copenhagen Applying for a PhD Doing a Postdoc CopeNLU Group Visiting the Group  Life in Copenhagen Copenhagen is lively and vibrant, yet comfortably-sized capital city by the North Sea on the border to Sweden with an oceanic climate. As it is located in Scandinavia, many of the corresponding stereotypes apply. Healthcare is socialised, public transport is cheap, working hours are short, taxes are high, but so are incomes. Denmark has been voted the happiest country in the world in 2016 and has kept a spot in the top three since, becoming a world-wide cultural phenomenon with many books published on the topic (some personal recommendations: \u0026ldquo;The Year of Living Danishly\u0026rdquo; by Helen Russell, and \u0026ldquo;The Almost Nearly Perfect People\u0026rdquo; by Michael Booth). Popular exports are hygge, beer and pork products. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t stop at traditional Danish food though as Copenhagen is also a leading gastro destination, being home to numerous fine dining restaurants.\nLiving in Copenhagen itself is a very relaxing experience. The city is very spacious compared to other capitals (think: London, New York, Tokyo), boasting large and open public spaces. Most people cycle to work and have a short commute, as it is easily possible to afford a city centre flat on an average salary. There are many things to do and explore in Copenhagen, from cozy bars and cafés to museums, the hipster district Vesterbro, the free town Christiania, and much more, as Copenhagen has incidentally also been voted the number 1 city to visit by Lonely Planet. The Copenhagen tourist board as well as the EMNLP 2017 local guide are excellent starting points for finding out more about what to do.\nFor practical advice about moving to Copenhagen, the International Staff Mobility Department at the University of Copenhagen provides information on topics ranging from housing to language classes. Speaking of, language classes are free for all new residents in Denmark \u0026ndash; not that one would need to speak Danish in order to get by in Copenhagen, as it is the capital city with the highest English profiency in the world in a country where English is not the first official language.\nLastly, another reason to move to Copenhagen is that academic salaries compare very favourably to other countries \u0026ndash; e.g. PhD salaries here are the highest in Europe \u0026ndash; meaning it is possible to live in Denmark comfortably as a researcher. An up-to-date overview of salaries by job category at the University of Copenhagen can also be found here.\n         NLP Research at the University of Copenhagen The NLP Section at the University of Copenhagen is currently home to four faculty members and many postdocs and PhD students, who work on topics including natural language understanding, multi-lingual learning, automatic fact checking, machine translation and multi-modal learning.\nNLP at the University of Copenhagen as a whole is highly productive and internationally well-regarded. For instance, we are ranked 2nd in Europe and 19th in the world on CSRankings for NLP), and were host to EMNLP 2017.\nApplying for a PhD PhD programs at the University of Copenhagen, and in Denmark in general, are fairly compact; students are expected to submit their thesis after three years, while an extension of one year can be granted. PhD students do not have to take courses during their studies, as they are expected to have completed a Master\u0026rsquo;s degree already. There are benefits and downsides to such a program structure, of course, and a more opinionated take on this can be found in this Quora post.\nThere are generally three routes to applying for a PhD:\n applying for a fully-funded position; applying with external funding; applying for an industrial PhD.  The first option is undoubtedly the most common one. Therein, a PhD fellowship is provided through a funded project, and the position is advertised on the KU job portal. The successful candidate becomes an employee at the University of Copenhagen, and in addition a PhD candidate registered with the PhD School. Depending on the funding source, a broad research topic is either already provided, or the topic is completely open. The Pioneer Centre for AI has an annual call for PhD positions with a deadline in Spring, typically a combination of pre-defined and open topic positions, which are additionally advertised on the Pioneer Centre\u0026rsquo;s website. Available positions in our group are also always advertised on the CopeNLU website.\nThe second option requires the PhD candidate to scure external funding to cover living expenses in Denmark for a three-year period. Funding can, for instance, come from a governmental scholarship programme, or from a central PhD funding call, such as the one by the Danish Data Science Academy (DDSA). For this, the candidate should contact the potential supervisor for their support to apply to the external funding programme, and, if funding is secured, apply for admission to the PhD School afterwards.\nThe third option is something fairly special to Denmark \u0026ndash; PhD students can study towards their PhD, while working at a company at the same time roughly one day a week. These PhD projects tend to be more applied and the topic for them is defined based on an agreement between the PhD advisor and the company. Funding for such projects is either obtained with or without a candidate for the position. As with the other two options, the PhD student is enrolled at the Doctoral School.\nAdditionally, candidates can express their interest for a PhD position by applying to the ELLIS PhD Programme. ELLIS is a central recruitment vehicle for AI labs across Europe and thus not directly offer PhD funding, so a dual application for external funding is required.\nMore information on the enrollment process at the Science Faculty Doctoral School is listed here.\nDoing a Postdoc Postdoc positions are available for anything between one and four years. Applicants are expected to have submitted their PhD thesis by the time they start, but it is typically not necessary for them to have been formally awarded a PhD yet, if they have sufficient evidence that this is likely to happen in the near future.\nThe routes to getting a postdoc position are very similar to those for a PhD position:\n applying for a fully-funded position; applying with external funding; applying for an industrial PhD.  Funded postdoc positions are often advertised on the KU job portal, though 1-year postdoc contracts can be offered without open calls. The postdoc topic varies widely based on the funding source. As for PhD positions, the Pioneer Centre for AI provides funding for postdocs, see the Pioneer Centre\u0026rsquo;s website, and positions are advertised Available positions in our group are also always advertised on CopeNLU website.\nIt is, furthermore, possible to start as a postdoc with already obtained funding, e.g. individual research fellowships. The topic for those is typically open and decided by the postdoc candidate. For some fellowship schemes, applications are made jointly with the host \u0026ndash; an example or this is the Danish Data Science Academy (DDSA) postdoctoral fellowship programme. Get in touch if you are interested in this option.\nLastly, industrial postdoc programs means a researcher works both at a university and at a company, roughly one day a week. The postdoc topic is typically more application-oriented and defined based on an agreement between the advisor and the company. Funding is either agreed upon with or without a candidate for the position.\nCopeNLU Group If you arrived on this page, you\u0026rsquo;ve likely already seen the rest of the CopeNLU website. We are an active and friendly multi-cultural research group at the Computer Science department at the University of Copenhagen, interested in natural language understanding. Our group is affiliated with the NLP Section, as well as with the Pioneer Centre for AI and located in the Observatory in the Botanical Gardens in central Copenhagen, near Nørreport Station. We are a very social and collaborative group, with weekly group meetings, biweekly reading groups, one-on-one supervision meetings, regular social events, and more. In addition to group-internal activities, there are also a number of events organised by the NLP section, Computer Science department and Pioneer Centre. This includes, among others, seminar series and workshops, PhD lunches, and social events. PhD students and postdocs are encouraged not to work on projects on their own, but rather form synergies with other group members based on common research interests. We strive to have a diverse and inclusive group atmosphere, welcoming applicants of all genders and from all cultures and backgrounds.\nCopeNLU is headed by Isabelle Augenstein and mainly supported by two prestigious early-career fellowships \u0026ndash; an ERC Starting Grant on \u0026lsquo;Explainable and Robust Automatic Fact Checking\u0026rsquo;, as well as the Danish equivalent of that, a DFF Sapere Aude Research Leader fellowship on \u0026lsquo;Learning to Explain Attitudes on Social Media\u0026rsquo;.\nVisiting the Group We are always open to short or longer-term visitors to the group, but do not provide internships for Bachelor\u0026rsquo;s or Master\u0026rsquo;s students. Funding for visits can typically not be provided, with the exception of invited speakers who give a talk at the Pioneer Centre or the SCIENCE AI Seminar Series.\n","date":1549065600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1699315200,"objectID":"dfe14b7cff1dd6a8394505f419e3da78","permalink":"https://copenlu.github.io/post/why-ucph/","publishdate":"2019-02-02T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/why-ucph/","section":"post","summary":"The University of Copenhagen is a great place if you're both interested in high-quality NLP research and a high quality of life.","tags":["Academic"],"title":"Interested in joining us at the University of Copenhagen?","type":"post"},{"authors":["Johannes Bjerva","Robert Östling","Maria Han Veiga","Jörg Tiedemann","Isabelle Augenstein"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1548979200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1548979200,"objectID":"77c14eca1f87d3b410f72a8c639228e9","permalink":"https://copenlu.github.io/publication/2019_cl_bjerva/","publishdate":"2019-02-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2019_cl_bjerva/","section":"publication","summary":"A neural language model trained on a text corpus can be used to induce distributed representations of words, such that similar words end up with similar representations. If the corpus is multilingual, the same model can be used to learn distributed representations of languages, such that similar languages end up with similar representations. We show that this holds even when the multilingual corpus has been translated into English, by picking up the faint signal left by the source languages. However, just like it is a thorny problem to separate semantic from syntactic similarity in word representations, it is not obvious what type of similarity is captured by language representations. We investigate correlations and causal relationships between language representations learned from translations on one hand, and genetic, geographical, and several levels of structural similarity between languages on the other. Of these, structural similarity is found to correlate most strongly with language representation similarity, while genetic relationships---a convenient benchmark used for evaluation in previous work---appears to be a confounding factor. Apart from implications about translation effects, we see this more generally as a case where NLP and linguistic typology can interact and benefit one another.","tags":[],"title":"What do Language Representations Really Represent?","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sebastian Ruder","Joachim Bingel","Isabelle Augenstein","Anders Søgaard"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1548892800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1548892800,"objectID":"c4469eafb02bfe1292a0bcad561bf951","permalink":"https://copenlu.github.io/publication/2019_aaai_ruder/","publishdate":"2019-01-31T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2019_aaai_ruder/","section":"publication","summary":"Multi-task learning (MTL) allows deep neural networks to learn from related tasks by sharing parameters with other networks.

Doing this manually is prohibitively time-consuming, which is in part evidenced by the fact that only 100 out of over 7,000 languages spoken in the world are fully covered in WALS. We learn distributed language representations, which can be used to predict typological properties on a massively multilingual scale. Additionally, quantitative and qualitative analyses of these language embeddings can tell us how language similarities are encoded in NLP models for tasks at different typological levels. The representations are learned in an unsupervised manner alongside tasks at three typological levels: phonology (grapheme-to-phoneme prediction, and phoneme reconstruction), morphology (morphological inflection), and syntax (part-of-speech tagging). We consider more than 800 languages and find significant differences in the language representations encoded, depending on the target task. For instance, although Norwegian Bokmal and Danish are typologically close to one another, they are phonologically distant, which is reflected in their language embeddings growing relatively distant in a phonological task. We are also able to predict typological features in WALS with high accuracies, even for unseen language families.","tags":[],"title":"From Phonology to Syntax: Unsupervised Linguistic Typology at Different Levels with Language Embeddings","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Isabelle Augenstein","Sebastian Ruder","Anders Søgaard"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1530403200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1530403200,"objectID":"59e919526653ad514493d33dd8423a61","permalink":"https://copenlu.github.io/publication/2018_naacl_augenstein/","publishdate":"2018-07-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2018_naacl_augenstein/","section":"publication","summary":"We combine multi-task learning and semisupervised learning by inducing a joint embedding space between disparate label spaces and learning transfer functions between label embeddings, enabling us to jointly leverage unlabelled data and auxiliary, annotated datasets.

Testing the effectiveness of four sequential classifiers -- Hawkes Processes, Linear-Chain Conditional Random Fields (Linear CRF), Tree-Structured Conditional Random Fields (Tree CRF) and Long Short Term Memory networks (LSTM) -- on eight datasets associated with breaking news stories, and looking at different types of local and contextual features, our work sheds new light on the development of accurate stance classifiers. We show that sequential classifiers that exploit the use of discourse properties in social media conversations while using only local features, outperform non-sequential classifiers. Furthermore, we show that LSTM using a reduced set of features can outperform the other sequential classifiers; this performance is consistent across datasets and across types of stances. To conclude, our work also analyses the different features under study, identifying those that best help characterise and distinguish between stances, such as supporting tweets being more likely to be accompanied by evidence than denying tweets.

The use of distributed representations in computational linguistics has also become increasingly popular. A recent development is to learn distributed representations of language, such that typologically similar languages are spatially close to one another. Although empirical successes have been shown for such language representations, they have not been subjected to much typological probing. In this paper, we first look at whether this type of language representations are empirically useful for model transfer between Uralic languages in deep neural networks. We then investigate which typological features are encoded in these representations by attempting to predict features in the World Atlas of Language Structures, at various stages of fine-tuning of the representations. We focus on Uralic languages, and find that some typological traits can be automatically inferred with accuracies well above a strong baseline. *Finnish Abstract*: Vaikka kielitypologialla on pitkä historia, siihen liittyvät laskennalliset menetelmät ovat vasta viime aikoina saavuttaneet suosiota.

Tässä artikkelissa tutkitaan, ovatko tällaiset kielirepresentaatiot empiirisesti käyttökelpoisia uralilaisten kielten välisissä mallimuunnoksissa syvissä neuroverkoissa. Pyrkimällä ennustamaan piirteitä \textit{World Atlas of Language Structures}-tietokannassa tutkimme, mitä typologisia ominaisuuksia nämä representaatiot sisältävät. Keskityimme uralilaisiin kieliin ja huomasimme, että jotkin typologiset ominaisuudet voidaan automaattisesti päätellä tarkkuudella, joka ylittää selvästi vahvan perustason.","tags":[],"title":"Tracking Typological Traits of Uralic Languages in Distributed Language Representations","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ed Collins","Isabelle Augenstein","Sebastian Riedel"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1498867200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1498867200,"objectID":"7551d306de802e85bed4c73da927408b","permalink":"https://copenlu.github.io/publication/2017_conll_collins/","publishdate":"2017-07-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2017_conll_collins/","section":"publication","summary":"Automatic summarisation is a popular approach to reduce a document to its main arguments. Recent research in the area has focused on neural approaches to summarisation, which can be very data-hungry. However, few large datasets exist and none for the traditionally popular domain of scientific publications, which opens up challenging research avenues centered on encoding large, complex documents. In this paper, we introduce a new dataset for summarisation of computer science publications by exploiting a large resource of author provided summaries and show straightforward ways of extending it further. We develop models on the dataset making use of both neural sentence encoding and traditionally used summarisation features and show that models which encode sentences as well as their local and global context perform best, significantly outperforming well-established baseline methods.","tags":[],"title":"A Supervised Approach to Extractive Summarisation of Scientific Papers","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Benjamin Riedel","Isabelle Augenstein","Georgios Spithourakis","Sebastian Riedel"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1498867200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1498867200,"objectID":"2ceef4e10df7fe69e161e122c1289476","permalink":"https://copenlu.github.io/publication/2017_arxiv_riedel/","publishdate":"2017-07-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2017_arxiv_riedel/","section":"publication","summary":"Identifying public misinformation is a complicated and challenging task.

This paper aims to quantify how this diversity impacts state-of-the-art NER methods, by measuring named entity (NE) and context variability, feature sparsity, and their effects on precision and recall. In particular, our findings indicate that NER approaches struggle to generalise in diverse genres with limited training data. Unseen NEs, in particular, play an important role, which have a higher incidence in diverse genres such as social media than in more regular genres such as newswire. Coupled with a higher incidence of unseen features more generally and the lack of large training corpora, this leads to significantly lower F1 scores for diverse genres as compared to more regular ones. We also find that leading systems rely heavily on surface forms found in training data, having problems generalising beyond these, and offer explanations for this observation.","tags":[],"title":"Generalisation in Named Entity Recognition: A Quantitative Analysis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Isabelle Augenstein","Anders Søgaard"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1498867200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1498867200,"objectID":"531bd207fb677a26642fb1f0fb61a1a0","permalink":"https://copenlu.github.io/publication/2017_acl_augenstein/","publishdate":"2017-07-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2017_acl_augenstein/","section":"publication","summary":"Keyphrase boundary classification (KBC) is the task of detecting keyphrases in scientific articles and labelling them with respect to predefined types.

One escalated issue is the increasing level of heterogeneity in the published resources. This seriously hampers interoperability of Semantic Web applications. A decade of effort in the research of Ontology Alignment has contributed to a rich literature to solve such problems. However, existing methods can be still limited as 1) they primarily address concepts and entities while relations are less well-studied; 2) many build on the assumption of the ‘well-formedness’ of ontologies which is unnecessarily true in the domain of Linked Open Data; 3) few looked at schema heterogeneity from a single source, which is also a common issue particularly in very large Linked Dataset created automatically from heterogeneous resources, or integrated from multiple datasets. This article aims to address these issues with a domain- and language-independent and completely unsupervised method to align equivalent relations across schemata based on their shared instances. We propose a novel similarity measure able to cope with unbalanced population of schema elements, an unsupervised technique to automatically decide similarity threshold to assert equivalence for a pair of relations, and an unsupervised clustering process to discover groups of equivalent relations across different schemata. Although the method is designed for aligning relations within a single dataset, it can also be adapted for cross-dataset alignment where sameAs links between datasets have been established. Using three gold standards created based on DBpedia, we obtain encouraging results from a thorough evaluation involving four baseline similarity measures and over 15 comparative models based on variants of the proposed method. The proposed method makes significant improvement over baseline models in terms of F1 measure (mostly between 7% and 40%), and it always scores the highest precision and is also among the top performers in terms of recall. We also make public the datasets used in this work, which we believe make the largest collection of gold standards for evaluating relation alignment in the LOD context.","tags":[],"title":"An

Previous work can be computationally intensive and is mainly based on low-level cues extracted from RGB data and implemented on a PC for a fixed sensor network (such as traditional CCTV). We present a practical and efficient framework for mobile devices (such as smart phones and robots) where high-level semantic soft biometrics are extracted from RGB and depth data. By combining these cues, our approach attempts to provide robustness to noise, illumination, and minor variations in clothing. This mobile approach may be particularly useful for the identification of persons in areas ill-served by fixed sensors or for tasks where the sensor position and direction need to dynamically adapt to a target. Results on the BIWI dataset are preliminary but encouraging. Further evaluation and demonstration of the system will be available on our website.","tags":[],"title":"A Person Re-Identification System For Mobile Devices","type":"publication_backup"},{"authors":["GA Cushen","MS Nixon"],"categories":null,"content":"More detail can easily be written here using Markdown and $\\rm \\LaTeX$ math code.\n","date":1372636800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1372636800,"objectID":"0af71cf2c5a7a78c0b9a5906512f8538","permalink":"https://copenlu.github.io/publication_backup/clothing-search/","publishdate":"2013-07-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication_backup/clothing-search/","section":"publication_backup","summary":"We present a mobile visual clothing search system whereby a smart phone user can either choose a social networking photo or take a new photo of a person wearing clothing of interest and search for similar clothing in a retail database. From the query image, the person is detected, clothing is segmented, and clothing features are extracted and quantized. The information is sent from the phone client to a server, where the feature vector of the query image is used to retrieve similar clothing products from online databases. The phone's GPS location is used to re-rank results by retail store location. State of the art work focuses primarily on the recognition of a diverse range of clothing offline and pays little attention to practical applications. Evaluated on a challenging dataset, the system is relatively fast and achieves promising results.","tags":[],"title":"Mobile visual clothing search","type":"publication_backup"}]
