      <title>Gender Bias Detection</title>

      <description>We are working on studying methods to detect gendered language automatically using unsupervised learning methods, such as variational auto-encoders. The findings of our first paper on this (Hoyle et al., 2019) have been reported by 75+ international news outlets, including Forbes.
Currently, we&amp;rsquo;re interested in expanding the above to a cross-lingual study, as well as researching the relationship between gender bias and attitudes towards entities on social media as part of a project funded by DFF.</description>
