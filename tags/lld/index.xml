      <title>Learning with Limited Labelled Data</title>

      <description>Learning with limited labelled data is useful for small domains or languages with little resources. Methods we research to mitigate problems arising in these contexts include multi-task learning, weakly supervised and zero-shot learning.
This is a cross-cutting theme in most of our research. Two previous projects specifically addressing this are Multi3Generation and Andreas Nugaard Holm&amp;rsquo;s industrial PhD project with BASE Life Science, supported by Innovation Fund Denmark.
Multi3Generation is a COST Action that funds collaboration of researchers in Europe and abroad.</description>

      <title>Multilingual Learning and Multicultural Learning</title>

      <description>Multi-lingual and multi-cultural learning are concerned with training models to work well for multiple languages and cultures, including low-resource ones. We research methods for enabling information sharing between multiple languages, and study how to utilise typological knowledge bases to this end. We further study cultural awarness of languages models. We are currently involved in two larger funded projects on this.
As part of a Carlsberg-funded project starting which started autumn 2023, we are investigating methods to understand what influences the employer images that organisations project in job ads.</description>
