      <description>A paper by CopeNLU author is accepted to appear at EACL 2021. The paper aims to bridge the gap between high- and low-resource languages by investigating to what degree cross-lingual models share structural information about languages.

      <description>2 papers by CopeNLU authors are accepted to appear at ACL 2020. One paper is on explainable fact checking, providing the first study of how fact checking explanations can be generated automatically based on claim content, and how this task can be modelled jointly with veracity prediction; whereas the other one is on script conversion, proposing a novel Chinese character conversion model that can disambiguate between mappings and convert between Chinese scripts.</description>

      <description>Multi-lingual learning is concerned with training models to work well for multiple languages, including low-resource ones. We research methods for enabling information sharing between multiple languages, and also study how to utilise typological knowledge bases to this end. We are currently involved in three larger funded projects on this.
Multi3Generation is a COST Action that funds collaboration of researchers in Europe and abroad. The project is coordinated by Isabelle Augenstein, and its goals are to study language generation using multi-task, multilingual and multi-modal signals.</description>
