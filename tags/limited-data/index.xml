      <title>2 Papers Accepted to AAAI 2022</title>
      <link>https://copenlu.github.io/talk/2021_12_aaai/</link>

      <guid>https://copenlu.github.io/talk/2021_12_aaai/</guid>
      <description>2 papers by CopeNLU authors are accepted to appear at AAAI 2022. One paper is on explanation generation, demonstrating how directly optimising for diagnostic properties of explanations, such as faithfulness, data consistency and confidence indication, can improve explanation quality. The other paper presents the most comprehensive study of cross-lingual stance detection to date, and proposes methods for learning with limited labelled data across languages and domains.

      <title>Learning with Limited Labelled Data</title>
      <link>https://copenlu.github.io/project/limited-data/</link>

      <description>Learning with limited labelled data is useful for small domains or languages with little resources. Methods we research to mitigate problems arising in these contexts include multi-task learning, weakly supervised and zero-shot learning.
This is a cross-cutting theme in most of our research. Two funded projects specifically addressing this are Multi3Generation and Andreas Nugaard Holm&amp;rsquo;s industrial PhD project with BASE Life Science, supported by Innovation Fund Denmark.
Multi3Generation is a COST Action that funds collaboration of researchers in Europe and abroad.</description>
